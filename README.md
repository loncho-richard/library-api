# ðŸ“š Library API

A RESTful API built with **FastAPI** for managing a library system. It allows you to manage authors, books, publishers, users, and loans.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture**:

- **Domain:** data models (`app/models`)
- **Persistence:** data access layer using repositories (`app/repositories`)
- **Application:** business logic (`app/services`)
- **Presentation:** HTTP endpoints (`app/api/routes`)

## ðŸš€ Stack

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- SQLModel + SQLite
- Alembic (migrations)
- Swagger (automatic documentation)

## ðŸ§  Data Transformation

The API responses are **denormalized**:

- `BookRead` includes `author_name`, `publisher_name`, `is_available`, and `due_date`
- `LoanRead` includes `book_title` and `user_name`
- This reduces the need for additional client-side queries

---

## ðŸ“Œ Technical Decisions

- `SQLModel` was chosen for its blend of Pydantic + SQLAlchemy
- Services contain business logic and data transformation
- The code uses **type hints** and is structured for testability
- Migrations are managed with **Alembic**
- The structure is scalable and ready for extensions
