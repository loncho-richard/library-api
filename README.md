# üìö Library API

A RESTful API built with **FastAPI** for managing a library system. It allows you to manage authors, books, publishers, users, and loans.

## üß± Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture**:

- **Domain:** data models (`app/models`)
- **Persistence:** data access layer using repositories (`app/repositories`)
- **Application:** business logic (`app/services`)
- **Presentation:** HTTP endpoints (`app/routes`)

## üöÄ Stack

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- SQLModel + SQLite
- Alembic (migrations)
- Swagger (automatic documentation)

## üë• Demo Users (Preloaded)

These demo users are created by `initial_data.py` when the database is first seeded:

| Name       | Email            | Password      |
|------------|------------------|---------------|
| Jhon Doe   | jhon@example.com | password123   |
| Jane Smith | jane@example.com | securepass456 |

## üì• CSV Data Upload

The API allows bulk book creation using a CSV file.

### üóÇÔ∏è Expected CSV Format

Make sure the `books.csv` file (located in the project root) folloes this format:

```csv
title,isbn,publication_year,author_id,publisher_id
The Hobbit,9780547928227,1937,1,1
1984,9780451524935,1949,2,2
```

### üöÄ Upload Endpoint

To upload the `books.csv` file, run:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@books.csv" http://localhost:8000/books/upload-csv
```
This endpoint will:

- Create authors and publishers if they don‚Äôt already exist.

- Create books associated with the correct author and publisher.

- Return a summary of successfully created books and any rows that failed validation.

        int user_id FK
        date loan_date
        date due_date
        date return_date
    }
```

## üß† Data Transformation

The API responses are **denormalized**:

- `BookRead` includes `author_name`, `publisher_name`, `is_available`, and `due_date`
- `LoanRead` includes `book_title` and `user_name`
- This reduces the need for additional client-side queries

---

## üìå Technical Decisions

- `SQLModel` was chosen for its blend of Pydantic + SQLAlchemy
- Services contain business logic and data transformation
- The code uses **type hints** and is structured for testability
- Migrations are managed with **Alembic**
- The structure is scalable and ready for extensions
